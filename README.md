# BIXCIP Smart Contracts

The smart contracts in this repository will be used by BIXCIP.

## Requirements

To run the project you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) development environment.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) for compiling, deploying and testing (installed globally via npm).
- (optional) [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for local testing (installed globally via npm).
- A file named `.env`
